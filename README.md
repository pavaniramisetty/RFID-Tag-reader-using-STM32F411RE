# RFID-Tag-reader-using-STM32F411RE
An STM32 tag reader using STM32F411RE is a system that reads RFID tags and sends the data to the cloud for monitoring. It uses the STM32 microcontroller to interface with the RFID module and display data, while cloud connectivity is achieved through UART communication instead of an ESP WiFi module, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.
